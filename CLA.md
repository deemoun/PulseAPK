# PulseAPK Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **PulseAPK**. In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, the project requires that You agree to the terms of this Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

This CLA is for your protection as a Contributor as well as for the protection of PulseAPK and its users; it allows us to distribute your contributions under the **Apache License 2.0** while guaranteeing that You retain ownership of your work.

## 1. Definitions

"**You**" (or "**Your**") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with PulseAPK. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.

"**Contribution**" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to PulseAPK for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by PulseAPK (the "**Work**"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to PulseAPK or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, PulseAPK for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to PulseAPK and to recipients of software distributed by PulseAPK a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

**You retain ownership of the copyright in Your Contributions.** Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a transfer of copyright ownership. You are free to use Your Contributions for any other purpose.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to PulseAPK and to recipients of software distributed by PulseAPK a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

## 4. Patent Retaliation

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this Agreement for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 5. Representations and Warranties

You represent that:
1.  **Originality**: You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If You are providing the Contribution on behalf of a company, You represent that You are authorized to do so.
2.  **No Violation**: Your Contribution is Your original creation and does not include any third-party proprietary information, trade secrets, or copyrighted material without proper authorization.
3.  **No Restrictions**: You are not aware of any agreements, including employment agreements, that would prevent You from contributing the Work under these terms.

## 6. Support

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND.
